ECP ST efforts contribute to the HPC software ecosystem in a variety of ways.  Most tangible are the contributions to software products, many of which are already widely deployed and being transformed for use with Exascale systems.  However, ECP ST contributes to industry and \textit{de facto} standards efforts.  Finally, some ECP ST efforts contribute to the upstream processes of requirements, analysis, design and prototyping that informs the implementation of vendor and other third-party software products.  While they do not receive the most attention, these upstream efforts are very impactful and low cost, without a product to support.

Building via Spack is required for participating in ECP ST releases: 48\% of products already support Spack.   24\% have Spack support in progress.  Use of Spack and the ECP ST SDKs will greatly improve builds from source. 81 of 89 packages support users via source builds.}}}
