\subsubsection{\stid{3.08} ForTrilinos}

\paragraph{Overview}

The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) requires the successful transformation and porting of many Fortran application codes in preparation for ECP platforms. A significant number of these codes rely upon the scalable solution of linear and nonlinear equations. The Trilinos Project contains a large and growing collection of solver capabilities that can utilize next-generation platforms, in particular scalable multicore, manycore, accelerator and heterogeneous systems. Trilinos is primarily written in C++, including its user interfaces. While C++ is advantageous for gaining access to the latest programming environments, it limits Trilinos usage via Fortran. Several ad hoc translation interfaces exist to enable Fortran usage of Trilinos, but none of these interfaces is general-purpose or written for reusable and sustainable external use.

ForTrilinos provides a seamless pathway for large and complex Fortran-based codes to access Trilinos without C/C++ interface code. This access includes Fortran versions of Kokkos abstractions for code execution and data management. The project uses an interface generator, SWIG, which the project is extending, to create the object-oriented Fotran wrapper code that users can access directly. This language translation will occur in both directions; ForTrilinos will provide an inversion of control functionality that enables custom extensions of the Trilinos solvers that are Fortran-based. Once the ForTrilinos project is complete, a functional, extensible suite of capabilities to access Trilinos on next-generation computing systems will be provided. Several examples of this technology will be demonstrated within ECP codes with the aim of meeting their simulation goals and illustrate the technology to other Fortran-based ECP codes. As a second benefit to ECP from this effort, the Fortrilinos approach of using SWIG to generate interfaces could be extended to other C/C++ based tools and software within the ECP stable.

\paragraph{Key  Challenges}

Developing the interfaces to the C++ libraries that provide access to cutting-edge research, such as Trilinos,  is of significant benefit to Fortran community. However, such interfaces must be well documented, sustainable and extensible, which would require significant amount of resources and investment. This is further complicated by the requirements to support heterogeneous platforms (e.g., GPUs) and inversion-of-control functionality. The manual approach to such interfaces has been shown to be unsustainable as it requires interface developers to have in-depth expertise in  multiple languages and the peculiarities in their interaction on top of the time commitment to update the interfaces with changes in the library.

ForTrilinos addresses both the issue of reducing interface generation cost through investment in tool configuration and usage to make the process as automatic as possible, and the issue of providing the full-featured interface to Trilinos library, including access to manycore, accelerator and heterogeneous solver capabilities in Trilinos.

\paragraph{Solution Strategy}

The ForTrilinos project has two primary thrusts:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{SWIG development to support Fortran wrapping:} The new Fortran
    module for SWIG allows for automatic generation of interfaces.
  \item \textbf{Incremental wrapping of selected Trilinos functionality:}
    ForTrilinos provides robust interfaces to selected Trilinos capabilities,
    including distributed data objects, linear and nonlinear solvers.
\end{enumerate}

ForTrilinos started with developing a Fortran module for the Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator (SWIG) utility~\cite{beazley1996swig}. SWIG is used to parse C++ code and generate wrapper code, and was already used for this purpose for several dozen target languages, most notably Python. The project took the approach of adding a Fortran 2003 wrapper generator for SWIG in order to fulfill many of the critical feature requirements for ForTrilinos.

The developed SWIG/Fortran functionality allowed to proceed with automatic generation of Fortran interfaces to selected Trilinos libraries. The work is conducted in phases, with each phase increasing the number of wrapped of Trilinos packages.

The first phase, completed in the first year, developed interfaces for a critical set of features required for solving linear and eigen-problems. The second phase addresses nonlinear solver, including developing automatic approach for inversion-of-control capability. Finally, in the third phase, the challenge of interoperable heterogeneous data passing between Fortran and C++, including GPU data, is addressed, including performance testing.

\paragraph{Recent Progress}

Figure~\ref{fig:fortran_ioc} illustrates a new Inversion-of-Control~(IoC)
implementation in ForTrilinos. The new approach allows Fortran users to define
an operator by using a derived type on the Fortran side, and use Trilinos
algorithms, e.g. Krylov solvers, to solve the linear system with that operator.

    \caption{\label{fig:fortran_ioc}The proposed Inversion-of-Control approach
    allowing Fortran applications to define operators on Fortran side while
    still using ForTrilinos types.}
\end{figure}

This approach allows the user callback functions to interact with native Fortran
types and ForTrilinos class wrapper types. In the same vein, users would not
have to manually pass \texttt{type(C\_PTR)} instances into and out of the
callback function, as the C++ Fortran conversions can be tedious and
error-prone, which indeed is the motivation for using SWIG to generate
ForTrilinos.  Another important feature is that it allows the application code
to extend Trilinos without having to generate any new interface code, either by
hand or using SWIG. In other words, the Fortran end user should not have to know
C++ or SWIG.

\paragraph{Next Steps}

Our next efforts include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Merge Fortran module to upstream SWIG:} The work is in progress
    to push the developed SWIG/Fortran functionality to upstream SWIG project.
    This would allow projects both inside and outside ECP ecosystem to start using
    this functionality independently of ForTrilinos to provide Fortran
    interfaces to their own libraries. We anticipate multiple projects taking
    advantage of this capability.
  \item \textbf{Provide wrappers for more libraries:} ForTrilinos will continue
    efforts to increase the number of wrapped Trilinos libraries. The next phase
    of the project will include libraries corresponding to nonlinear solvers,
    such as NOX. We anticipate that once that functionality is available, many
    applications in ECP, including E3SM-MMF, will be able to start using ForTrilinos in the
    production.
  \item \textbf{Provide interfaces for heterogeneous platforms:} ForTrilinos
    will develop support for heterogeneous memory through providing access to
    Kokkos-based interfaces in Trilinos. This will allow full exposure to
    Trilinos capabilities targeting Exascale machines.
\end{enumerate}
